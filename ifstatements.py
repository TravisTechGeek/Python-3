# If Statements
# Enter a user name here, make sure to make it a string
# Dave keeps logging into my computer without permission. 
user_name = "angela_catlady_87"
# we have created this if statement to print a message to dave if he tries to log in
if user_name == "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")
# remember = is used to assign variables, while == the relational operator is used to see if the two itwms are equal to each other 
# remember if statements will also require a : 
if user_name == "angela_catlady_87":
  print("I know it is you, Dave! Go away!")
# dave sometimes also will login to our computer using angelas username
#notice if you change the user_name to anything other than the two usernames above nothing is printed in the terminal
