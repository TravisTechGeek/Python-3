# Two of the most common NYC attractions include the Empire State Building and Times Square.

# In travel.py, we’ll write a function that prints the directions via subway from the Empire State Building to Times Square.

# First, define a function, directions_to_timesSq(). Leave the body of the function empty for now.

# Note: When we run the code, we will see an error: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing. This will occur when we don’t populate a function with any statements. We will populate it with code in the next step.

# EOF stands for “End of File” — Python is telling you that it was expecting some code in the body of the function, but it hit the end of the file first.
def directions_to_timesSq():
# Within the body of the function, use three print() statements to output the following directions:
# Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station
# Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop
# Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop

    print("Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station")
    print("Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop")
    print("Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop")
